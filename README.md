# Deep_Learning_Image_Classifier

## SI 670 (Applied Machine Learning) - Kaggle Competition
This notebook is the cleaned version of the code used to create a deep learning image classifier for a Kaggle competition. The objective of the competition was to create a model that can accurately classify sinks as being either kitchen sinks or bathroom sinks. The train and test set is a collection of images of kitchen and bathroom sinks. 

This submission placed 4th out of 20 teams and accurately predicts 143/149 of the images in the test set (96% accuracy).
